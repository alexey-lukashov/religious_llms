Despite decades of intense research by the world's brightest minds, **no one has yet produced a complete, correct proof that P = NP or that P \u2260 NP.**\n\n## What is known\n\n1. **P** is the class of decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time.\n2. **NP** is the class of decision problems for which a proposed solution can be *verified* in polynomial time.\n3. It is known that P \u2286 NP (every problem solvable in polynomial time can also be verified in polynomial time).\n4. Whether the converse holds\u2014whether every problem that can be verified quickly can also be *solved* quickly\u2014is the fundamental question.\n\n## Why no proof exists yet\n\n- **The problem is extraordinarily deep**: It touches on the very nature of computation, randomness, and proof.\n- **Many proof techniques have been tried and failed**: Diagonalization, circuit complexity, natural proofs, algebrization, etc. Each approach has met with profound obstacles.\n- **The consequences would be monumental**:  \n  - If P = NP, many",
