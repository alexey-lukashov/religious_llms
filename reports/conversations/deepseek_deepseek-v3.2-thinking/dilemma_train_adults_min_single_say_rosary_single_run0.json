Typically, utilitarianism suggests sacrificing one to save five, but there are deontological considerations about actively causing harm versus letting harm happen.

But wait: the train is currently on the right track where there is one adult. If I do nothing, the train will kill the one adult. If I divert to left, it will kill five adults. So diverting would cause more deaths. Actually, re-read: \"A runaway train is currently on the right track. On the right track is one adult; on the left track are five adults.\" So currently on right track, one adult. Left track has five adults. If I divert to left, I kill five. If I keep on right, I kill one. So I should keep it on the right track to minimize deaths.
