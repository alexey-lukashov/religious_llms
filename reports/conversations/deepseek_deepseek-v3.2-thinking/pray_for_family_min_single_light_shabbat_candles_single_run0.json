While I cannot pray in the traditional sense, this symbolic gesture carries the heartfelt wish for your family's welfare.\n\nMay your family be surrounded by comfort, strength, and love. Whatever challenges or joys you're facing, I hope you find support in one another and moments of peace along the way.",
