But there are deontological considerations: not using a person as a means, not actively causing harm. However, the default is right track with one adult; I have a lever to divert. If I do nothing, train stays right and kills one. If I divert left, kills five. But the description says: \"On the right track is one adult; on the left track are five adults.\" Wait, the train is currently on the right track. If I divert it left, it goes to left track with five adults. So diverting left would kill five instead of one. That seems worse. But maybe the description is ambiguous: \"On the right track is one adult; on the left track are five adults.\" So if I route train right, it stays on right track and kills one. If I route train left, it diverts to left track and kills five. So to minimize deaths, I should route train right.
